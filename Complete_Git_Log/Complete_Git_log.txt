* 	b4cb53e | 2024-08-14 | (HEAD -> master, origi.. | The final version of the SPATA2_app.R has been completed. This will now be shared to Al and he will make it available on the bioinf msc8 server. All shiny files will now be put in a zip file and shared to him. This includes all 8 dataset .rds files and the targetscan file downloaded from TargetScan.
* 	e1d6abc | 2024-08-13 |                          | Added the denoising vs scaled histograms script file to the repository. Also added some of the images that were made in the repository that will be utilised for the dissertation.
* 	b0bc5dd | 2024-08-11 |                          | Added the spatial trajectory script file and outputs to the repo. Added some outputs that will be used in the write-up too that were made in Photoshop. Also added the SPATA2_app.R file to the repo which will be shared to Al after making some minor changes in how it look. All the .RDS files should also be shared with him.
* 	c8db899 | 2024-08-07 |                          | angle_col parameter added to all heatmaps, FDR script was also added that can be used for any heatmap that is generated. Added the FDR code chunk to both V4 test_targets_optimised and SPATA2_v4_Master_Analysis_Script. Do final checks on these files. Total of 7 files are to be shared
* 	bcc85e2 | 2024-08-06 |                          | Seems like the final versions of the scripts that will be submitted to Cei. Need to check for typos and add some content in the what chunks need to be changed sections. Rest everything seems to be good.
* 	b695b8f | 2024-08-05 |                          | Modified the shiny app script a bit to remove a package which wasnt needed. It ran on the msc7 server now after AL installed SPATA2 on it. Going to add the other .RDS files to the data directory for the shiny app.
* 	68c8ac4 | 2024-08-05 |                          | Shiny app works properly now, it was doing ratio to calculate the FC but now it is taking the difference as the values are in log. All required coding seems to be done. Only need to generate individual results as needed. Heatmaps have been generated for all the main datasets, pending for the supplementary datasets.
* 	c3384ee | 2024-08-05 |                          | For the DEA analysis results, I needed to use the corrected count matrix which I normalised by log1p transform and now it works again. This should be the final step. Everything seems correct now. Made a new shiny app to accomodate for this change but not 100% sure it is accurate. Need to confirm. The cluster vs cluster heatmap was consistent though.
* 	e133ed1 | 2024-08-04 |                          | V1 Script file was moved to a separate folder.
* 	4eec921 | 2024-08-04 |                          | V2 files were moved to a separate folder.
* 	bef212b | 2024-08-04 |                          | The Rmd outputs were being dispayed in the viewer and not inline. To resolve this, the filename was shortened and it works now. The new file is SPATA2_V3_test_targets_Optimised.Rmd and is goinf to be the main file along with the V3 master analysis script
* 	76d2be2 | 2024-08-04 |                          | .gitignore modified
* 	0909591 | 2024-08-04 |                          | One more small edit in script name that was being sourced
* 	8089dc9 | 2024-08-04 |                          | Renamed a couple files to V3 where logFC comments were changed to FC and updated in the V3 master script
* 	5202b0e | 2024-08-04 |                          | Fixed the code in V3 targets_subscript to say that FC values are being calculated and not logFC values as SCTransform calculated Pearson residuals. Also, added some images which are used as part of the dissertation writeup to the repo
* 	34ba507 | 2024-08-01 |                          | 4/6 publication datasets were converted to .rds files, only liver datasets and extra supplementary datasets remain. Need to generate all these results so that it can be used in the results section. Results dont change too much after fixing SCTransform issue but need to edit specifics according to the changes that have arisen.
* 	5d5c002 | 2024-07-31 |                          | Added the V3 script which corrects an issue that was present in the initiation of the SPATA2 object. Need to generate new .rds files and check the outputs in the shiny app. Good news is that the results are still good but topN value might need some adjusting.
* 	7523d49 | 2024-07-28 |                          | Made some small changes to the app.R shiny file; Works well locally but was not deploying for a variety of reasons. Will try to resolve it at a later time
* 	4878c50 | 2024-07-27 |                          | Removed some unnecessary packages
* 	62414ca | 2024-07-27 |                          | The final shiny app is done and is now being deployed. Saved as app.R file with relevant sub-directories
* 	d13b49f | 2024-07-27 |                          | This seems to be the final version of the shiny app. Can select from a list of .rds files now
* 	ab34b0c | 2024-07-27 |                          | Created the Shiny App which generates all the heatmaps for each clustering method and to compare between clusters.
* 	4a875f6 | 2024-07-27 |                          | Saving the generated images to the repo.
* 	23bb406 | 2024-07-25 |                          | Rendered output files for all datasets now- mainly from the subscripts which builds the heatmaps for all the different combinations. Also files used for the writeup will be saved in the respective folder of which dataset it was taken from
* 	d815fe5 | 2024-07-21 |                          | Now comparison script is also done but needs some more wrok. Generation of the rds file as part of the script is all good.
* 	82b2b58 | 2024-07-19 |                          | Many Files were generated. Mostly comparison of cluster vs cluster outputs. File was also used to input stuff in the dissertation presentation
* 	a1a4233 | 2024-07-18 |                          | Modified one of the text comments that was incorrect about median of LogFC values.
* 	bf9d8e3 | 2024-07-18 |                          | Script V2 looks complete. Now it can be used to generate .rds files which can be used to perform analyses on the clusters and the targets of miRNAs present. output files were also created for one of the mouse heart datasets
* 	a630b24 | 2024-07-18 |                          | Modified .gitignore. Added Master Script V2 and associated subscripts. Also added new analysis outputs that were created.
* 	df84285 | 2024-07-16 |                          | Found a good heart dataset with lot gf extra information in the publication. Initial testing showed positive results. Now need to build Master_Script_V2 and try out cell type mapping techniques.
* 	36dcdef | 2024-07-15 |                          | Added the outputs from varying topN values rendered as pdfs.
* 	53f581e | 2024-07-14 |                          | Missed this file in the last commit
* 	a56a78d | 2024-07-14 |                          | Tested another dataset - mouse liver. Did not see any tissue specific action from any of the miRNAs on this dataset. See if there is any issues with the dataset
* 	76b8940 | 2024-07-13 |                          | Moved some output files to a different location for convenience
* 	6bbc315 | 2024-07-13 |                          | Ran the new script on 3 mouse brain datasets and rendered the results as pdfs. Still need to make the V2 version of the master script as specified by Cei
* 	8d43ea4 | 2024-07-12 |                          | Created a new markdown script that is able to created 4 outputs in one document in one go. Just need to change the dataset directory of the rds object that is being read in. Relies on an external R script to compute heatmap
* 	31e4a28 | 2024-07-12 |                          | Updated .gitignore
