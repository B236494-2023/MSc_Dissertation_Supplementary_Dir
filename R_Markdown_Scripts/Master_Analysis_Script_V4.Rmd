: Chunks to be changed for new dataset

## Start of Pipeline, SPATA2 Object Creation

The script works only if you use Seurat V 5.0.3 & SPATA2 V 2.0.4 currently (as noted on 15/08/24).

The link to the 10x dataset used here is: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM5764419>

Title: FF_Adult_Mouse_Brain_Coronal_V3

Species, Tissue: Mouse, Brain

Note: Denoising Assessement and saving as .rds file is turned off by default. Turn on as needed.

```{r Creating spata2 object from 10x Dataset, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


# This is how a 10x Dataset from https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets

# dataset_10x_dir has to be changed depending on where the dataset is stored
# Make sure you are in the right directory with the required files
# Ensure that the .h5 is named as "filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5"

master_script_rmd_dir <- getwd()

```

## Setting which dataset will be the main spata2 object

```{r Setting which spata2 object to use downstream}

# Depending on which dataset we want to use further
# Change the object which is being assigned to main_spata2_obj
# All the analysis (clustering, DEA) will be done and saved to the main_spata2_obj_hi_res
# main_spata2_obj_low_res is not really needed but is useful to know

main_spata2_obj_hi_res <- spata2_obj_10x

```

```

## Imaging the Dataset

```{r Viewing high_res images of the dataset}

text_size <- theme(text = element_text(size = 12))

xrange <- c("2.5mm", "6.5mm")
yrange <- c("3.5mm", "7.5mm")

# where to set the breaks is a measure of distance, too

breaks_x <- str_c(0:8, "mm")

# Display the combined plot

```

## The optimal neural network set up for denoising

## Denoising (Assessment)

This is turned off by default. Turn on if needed.

```{r Denoising the data (assessment), eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# Run this script to obtain the Autoencoder Assessment Result

source("SPATA2_V2_Denoising_Subscript.R")

plotAutoencoderAssessment(object = main_spata2_obj_hi_res)

getAutoencoderAssessment(main_spata2_obj_hi_res)

```

## Denoising (Execution)

```{r Denoising the data (execution), eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}


# This worked after i did this
# main_spata2_obj_hi_res@gdata[["V1_Adult_Mouse_Brain_Coronal_Section_spatial"]] 
# <- gene_metadata_main_spata2_obj_hi_res

# Assign an empty list to the gdata slot
# Usually remains empty if SCTransform = TRUE, when creating the spata2 object
main_spata2_obj_hi_res@gdata <- list()

# This works now
main_spata2_obj_hi_res <- computeGeneMetaData(main_spata2_obj_hi_res) 

# Parameters Need to be changed for each dataset
# typically relu gave the best performance

main_spata2_obj_hi_res <-
    runAutoencoderDenoising(
    object = main_spata2_obj_hi_res,
    activation = "relu",
    mtr_name_output = "denoised",
    bottleneck = 56,
    epochs = 20,
    layers = c(128, 64, 32),
    dropout = 0.1
    )


```

## Denoising (Plotting an Example)

```{r denoised vs scaled , eval=TRUE}

# The genes might need to be changed depending on the dataset

# # all expression matrices after denoising
getExpressionMatrixNames(object = main_spata2_obj_hi_res)

# not denoised
main_spata2_obj_hi_res <- setActiveMatrix(object = main_spata2_obj_hi_res, mtr_name = "scaled")

# change pt_size 

plot1 <- plotSurface(
  object = main_spata2_obj_hi_res, 
  color_by = "Sox17", 
  pt_size = 2.5,
  pt_alpha = 3,
  display_image = FALSE
) + 
  labs(title = "Scaled (not denoised)")

# denoised
main_spata2_obj_hi_res <- setActiveMatrix(object = main_spata2_obj_hi_res, mtr_name = "denoised")

plot2 <- plotSurface(
  object = main_spata2_obj_hi_res, 
  color_by = "Sox17",
  pt_size = 2.5,
  display_image = FALSE
  ) + 
  labs(title = "Denoised")

# Combine the plots side by side
combined_plot <- plot1 | plot2

# Display the combined plot
print(combined_plot)

```

## Clustering or Segmentation of the Dataset

There are many methods of clustering the dataset and which method should be used is up to the need of the situation. The clustering methods that will be used here are:

-   Hartigan-Wong K-means Algorithm and

-   BayesSpace.

BayesSpace requires a `filtered_feature_bc_matrix/`Â subdirectory for it to work properly so it worth keeping in mind that it needs to be made for it work alongwith the already essential `spatial/` subdirectory that is used to load the dataset in the `initiateSpataObject_10X()`. So I guess that means it wont run with a SPATAData object as we dont have those files available for it.

```{r Build Clusters, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Run this script to obtain clustering results
# which will be saved to the spata2 object

source("SPATA2_V2_Clustering_Subscript.R")

plot1 <- plotSurface(
  object = main_spata2_obj_hi_res,
  color_by = "bayes_space",
  pt_size = 2,
  pt_clrp = "uc"
) +
  labs(subtitle = "Bayes Space Clusters")

plot2 <- plotSurface(
  object = main_spata2_obj_hi_res,
  color_by = "kmeans_4_HW",
  pt_clrp = "uc",
  pt_size = 2,
)+
  labs(subtitle = "HW Kmeans Clusters")

# Combine the plots side by side
combined_plot <- plot1 | plot2

# Display the combined plot
print(combined_plot)

```

## Dimension Reduction Plots for the Clustering techniques

Added UMAP and t-SNE plots for both clustering techniques. Probably makes more sense to put these immediately after each clustering step for quick visualisation and the colour of each cluster on the histology imaging and the dim-red plots are consistent.

```{r Dim Red Plots, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}

# Run this script to obtain dim red plots

plot1 <- plotUmap(
  main_spata2_obj_hi_res,
  color_by = "bayes_space",
  color_aes = "color"
)+
  labs(subtitle = "UMAP Plot of bayes_space clustered genes")


plot2 <-plotUmap(
  main_spata2_obj_hi_res,
  color_by = "kmeans_4_HW",
  color_aes = "color"
)+
  labs(subtitle = "UMAP Plot of kmeans_4_HW clustered genes")

# Combine the plots side by side
combined_plot <- plot1 | plot2

# Display the combined plot
print(combined_plot)


plot1 <-plotTsne(
  main_spata2_obj_hi_res,
  color_by = "bayes_space",
  color_aes = "color"
)+
  labs(subtitle = "t-SNE Plot of bayes_space clustered genes")


plot2 <-plotTsne(
  main_spata2_obj_hi_res,
  color_by = "kmeans_4_HW",
  color_aes = "color"
)+
  labs(subtitle = "t-SNE Plot of kmeans_4_HW clustered genes")

# Combine the plots side by side
combined_plot <- plot1 | plot2

# Display the combined plot
print(combined_plot)

```

## Save RDS object at this point if needed

This is turned off by default. Turn it on if needed.

```{r Save the spata2 obj before performing DEA if needed}

# Using sample name from start of the script
# Concatenate the sample name with the desired file suffix
rds_file_name <- paste0(sample_name_spata2_obj, "_V3_denoised.rds")

saveRDS(main_spata2_obj_hi_res, file = rds_file_name)

# This is how to load up the saved .rds file
# main_spata2_obj_hi_res <- readRDS("GSM5691527_Sample_C7d_185B1_4_denoised.rds")


```
